# ROSMAP_RNA_k-cores

Series of R scripts to perform primary analysis of undirected gene expression networks from the ROSMAP database (RNAseq normalized to FPKM). 
The final approach is to perform center-periphery analysis (coreness analysis) in subjects with Alzheimer's disease, mild cognitive impairment and no reported dementia.
